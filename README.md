# Server part of a Client-Server Store Application
This program is a part of an application which works over the internet and allows for managing a small store's product database.

It is recomended to firstly setup this part and then go on to setup the [Client Part](https://github.com/andrewromanyk/StoreClientPart).
## Setup
- Copy the repository
- Change the database link in files DBHandler.java (line 89) and hibernate.cfg.xml (line 5) to your own
- Create a .jar file (you may skip this step if you want to run it locally)
- If created, deploy the generated archive to a server (or run it locally)
- Setup the [Client Part](https://github.com/andrewromanyk/StoreClientPart).
